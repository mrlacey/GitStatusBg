# gitstatusbg README

Visual Studio Code extension that sets the background color of the editor to indicate the Git status of the file.

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

The default (built-in) GIT provider is used to get the status of files. If you're not using this, or if you're not using GIT as a source control system this extension isn't going to be of much use to you.

## Extension Settings

Settings exist to adjust the tint color that is applied to the background. Adjust based on your preference.

* `gitstatusbg.untrackedFileBackground`: the tint color to use for untracked files
* `gitstatusbg.modifiedFileBackground`: the tint color to use for modified files
